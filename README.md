# Storify is a web application where users can create/add their own stories and can read the stories of other users. I have used the interative CKEditor which has cool in-build features.

Functionalities:

Users can make their story either public or private
Edit the story created by them
Delete the story created by them
Cannot edit/delete story of other users
View the profile of the users they are interested in and can see all of their stories
